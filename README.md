SQL + Python in Jupyter Notebook: Business Insights from E-Commerce Data

Recently, I worked on a data-driven project using SQL and Python in Jupyter Notebook to extract valuable business insights. We tackled key business problems through structured queries, covering everything from basic aggregations to advanced analytics.

**Basic Queries:**
1. Identified unique customer locations
2. Counted orders from 2017
3. Analyzed total sales per category
4. Measured installment-based purchases
5. Segmented customers by state

**Intermediate Queries:**
1. Analyzed monthly order trends in 2018
2. Examined product purchasing patterns by city
3. Calculated revenue contribution by category
4. Identified correlation between price and purchase frequency
5. Ranked sellers based on total revenue

**Advanced Queries:**
1. Calculated moving average of order values
2. Analyzed cumulative sales and year-over-year growth
3. Measured customer retention trends (repeat purchases in 6 months)
4. Identified top three high-spending customers each year
5. This project demonstrated how SQL and Python can unlock powerful business insights, optimize decision-making, and drive growth.
