SQL + Python in Jupyter Notebook: Business Insights from E-Commerce Data

Recently, I worked on a data-driven project using SQL and Python in Jupyter Notebook to extract valuable business insights. We tackled key business problems through structured queries, covering everything from basic aggregations to advanced analytics.

**Basic Queries:**
Identified unique customer locations
Counted orders from 2017
Analyzed total sales per category
Measured installment-based purchases
Segmented customers by state

**Intermediate Queries:**
Analyzed monthly order trends in 2018
Examined product purchasing patterns by city
Calculated revenue contribution by category
Identified correlation between price and purchase frequency
Ranked sellers based on total revenue

**Advanced Queries:**
Calculated moving average of order values
Analyzed cumulative sales and year-over-year growth
Measured customer retention trends (repeat purchases in 6 months)
Identified top three high-spending customers each year
This project demonstrated how SQL and Python can unlock powerful business insights, optimize decision-making, and drive growth.
